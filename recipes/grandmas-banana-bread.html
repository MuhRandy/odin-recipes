    <h2>Descriptions</h2>

    <p>A super moist banana bread which uses six bananas!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>3 cups sugar</li>

      <li>1 cup margarine, softened</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>

      <li>4 eggs</li>

      <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>

      <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>

      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>

      <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>

      <li>6 very ripe bananas, mashed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13
        inch baking pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a large bowl, cream together the sugar and margarine until light and
        fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition,
        then stir in the vanilla.
      </li>

      <li>
        In a large bowl, sift together flour, baking soda and salt. Blend this
        mixture into the egg mixture, alternately with the buttermilk; stir just
        to combine. Fold in the mashed bananas; mixing just enough to evenly
        combine. Pour batter into prepared pan.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center of the
        loaf comes our clean, about 60 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>Enjoy!</li>
